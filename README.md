## Details
1. Course 2: Python Introduction
  - Loaded data from a `csv` file with Pandas
  - Retrieved preliminary information and statistics
  - Analyzed some features, especially in relation to the target variable, `claim_status`
  - Concluded that there is a large difference in `likes`, `comments`, `views`, etc. between different `claim_status`
2. Course 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Constructed visualizations using Seaborn (histograms, box plots, pie charts, bar graphs, scatterplots, etc.)
  - Analyzed distribution of features by class (of the target variable)
  - Checked for statistical outliers
  - Made conclusions about `author_ban_status` and other variables in relation to `claim_status`
3. Course 4: Hypothesis Testing
  - Checked for missing data
  - Prepared hypotheses for hypothesis testing
  - Conducted a t-test to determine stastical significance
4. Course 5: Regression Modeling
  - Made plots
  - Handled outliers
5. Course 6: Machine Learning Models
  - Split data into train, validation, and test sets
  - Trained a Random Forest Model (from `sklearn`) on the data
  - Trained an XGBoost Model (from `xgboost`) on the data
  - Used Grid Search to tune hyperparameters
  - Evaluated the model using metrics and confusion matrices
